Argentina, with approximately 46 million Spanish speakers, ranks fourth globally in Spanish-speaking populations, following Mexico, which has over 120 million. Despite Spanish being the primary language for communication, education, and public administration, Argentina does not have an official language designated by law. Historically, Spanish was the official language during colonial rule but was not enforced against indigenous languages.

In addition to Spanish, Italian is the second most spoken language, with around 1.5 million speakers, largely due to 19th and 20th-century immigration. English, while spoken by about 100,000 natives, is widely used as a second language, especially among younger generations influenced by American pop culture. Indigenous languages, including Guarani (200,000 speakers), Quechua (65,000), and Mapudungun, also contribute to Argentina's linguistic diversity, reflecting the country’s rich cultural heritage. The interplay of these languages continues to shape Argentina's evolving language landscape, fostering a unique blend of linguistic influences.
