ModelFront has announced the general availability of its Automatic Post-Editing (APE) feature, which is now included by default for all customers. Initially launched in 2024, APE enhances the company's existing Quality Prediction (QP) system, which automates the verification of AI-generated translations while maintaining human quality. APE specifically addresses repetitive edits that previously required human intervention, allowing for increased automation without sacrificing translation quality. 

The integration of APE has reportedly resulted in hundreds of millions of additional automated words for enterprise translation buyers, particularly among Fortune 500 companies. It works seamlessly with various translation tools and AI sources, ensuring data privacy by not sharing customer data with third-party AI. ModelFront's approach aims to streamline translation processes across multiple industries, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high-quality outputs while scaling operations. The company is recognized as a leader in the translation technology sector, with a vision to enhance global communication through improved translation capabilities.
