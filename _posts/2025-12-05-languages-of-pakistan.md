Pakistan, the fifth most populous country with 240 million people, has a rich linguistic landscape featuring over 70 languages. The official languages are Urdu and English. Urdu, which emerged from a blend of several languages, was chosen as the national language post-independence in 1947, primarily due to its association with the Muslim identity and political movement for independence. Although only about 9.2% of the population speaks Urdu as their mother tongue, it serves as the lingua franca in administration and education. Punjabi is the most widely spoken native language, with around 37% of the population, but it was not designated as the official language due to its many dialects and the political influence of Urdu speakers. Other significant languages include Sindhi and Pashto, each spoken by approximately 15% of the population. The continued growth of Pakistan's population suggests a rising demand for language services, as many citizens are also moving abroad, spreading their languages globally.
