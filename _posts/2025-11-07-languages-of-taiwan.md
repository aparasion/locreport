Taiwan, home to 23.5 million people, showcases a rich linguistic diversity, with Mandarin Chinese as the official language since 1945. While Mandarin is widely spoken and used in public administration and business, Taiwanese Hokkien serves as the primary vernacular language, reflecting the island's historical context. Hakka, spoken by about 6% of the population, and various indigenous languages, collectively known as Formosan languages, also contribute to Taiwan's linguistic landscape, although they face declining usage.
